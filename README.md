Blockchain based solution for online Voting using Node.js, ReactJs, Solidity. Presented as the Capstone Project for the Blockchain Development program from George Brown College.

# Introduction #
Voting is the method for a group or a community to take a collective decision with or without discussions, debates etc. As far as the statistics are concerned there are 165 democracies in the world which consist of both full and flawed democracies. All these democracies need voting to work and function properly. 

The conventional methods of voting such are Electronic Voting Machines or Ballot Voting have proven to be vulnerable to issues such as Ballot Stuffing, EVM tampering, Booth Capturing etc. So blockchain can prove to be a boon for the voting and some of the benefits are:
1. Tamper Proof Voting
2. Convenient 
3. Anonymity
4. Trustable voting system
5. Environment Friendly
